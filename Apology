Good Evening Sir. I am writing to express my deepest apologies for the late submission of my recent assignments for your CSC 312 class. I realise the need to complete assignents on time, and I deeply regret any inconvenience my delay may have caused.

I Faced issues in completing the assignment on time. Despite my best efforts to meet the deadline, I underestimated the time required to address these issues.

I take full responsibility for my actions, and I understand the need for early submission. I assure you that I have taken steps to prevent such delays in the future. I have learned from this experience and will make every effort to submit assignments on time going forward.

I kindly request your understanding and forgiveness and would be grateful if you could consider my assignment for marking. I understand if any late penalties apply, and I am willing to accept the consequences of my actions.

Once more, I sincerely apologize for my late submission caused. I appreciate your understanding and consideration in this matter.
